Business Repricing Exceptions:

In the context of business repricing, when we say "Skipping Repricing!", it indicates to ignore the processing for a specific business or tier. This action involves excluding that particular repricing process, and if there are any exceptional cases relevant to this choice, those will be mentioned in the message. This approach is taken because there are often multiple prices that need to be adjusted in the case of B2B.

 

1)	If “b2b_rules” is missing in listing data:

b2b_rules is missing in Listing Data



2)	If our seller have the buy box (in case compete_with: MATCH_BUYBOX):

Skipping Repricing! (Our seller have the buy box for this Quantity)

3)	If our seller have the buy box in tier quantity match case (in case compete_with: MATCH_BUYBOX):

Skipping Repricing! (Our seller have the buy box for this Quantity)

4)	If tier quantity is missing but listing price is available: 

Skipping Repricing! (Tier Quantity is Missing)

Default: MATCH_BUYBOX

Default: 0 (matching the price).

max_price_rule:

This field determines the strategy when the updated price is higher than the maximum price. Possible values are:



1)	JUMP_TO_MIN: Set the minimum price if it's lower than the minimum.

2)	JUMP_TO_MAX: Set the maximum price as the new price.

Note: 

In JUMP_TO_AVG case, when there is no minimum price or maximum price then we dont reprice.

Default: Average (if not present).



Inventory_age_rules:

This inventory_age_rules is considered when the inventory_age in listing data is greater than 0, Otherwise Normal repricing is done. Normal Repricing is a kind of repricing in which we don't go into the inventory_age_rules ranges to find the strategy, instead we apply the default strategy.

1)	0-90

2)	91-180

3)	181-270

4)	270-365

5)	365+

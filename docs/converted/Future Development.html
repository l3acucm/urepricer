--	Maximize profit in strategy

	--	In case of single only seller, go to default, if default is not present, go to average (if both min/max present)

	--	If we own the buybox, and thereâ€™s seller on higher price with buybox eligibility, we jump to them.



--	Add `success` field true/false and `error` with error description on feed ready and send these along with same message to same kafka topic we are already using. (update the document with the format)

--	Delete seller with all listing, optimize the deletion process, for expire we need to include latest update in each ASIN, so we can manually expire it.

--	Logging is happening currently, but the plan is to price change loging decided time series db.

--	Consider Feed submission refresh rate. Convert the products into size and maximise around 10MB



--	23- AvailabilityType -> Now

	--	It will be discussed later





Later to consider

--	Positioning it on higher end during night

	--	Raise prices for products currently listed at their minimum price during non-peak hours, enabling the repricing cycle to continue.

1)	As Listing data is in Redis, so we need to iterate through listing in Redis.

2)	Non peak hours for US and UK market place are different , so separate cronjobs for each market.

3)	How much price we gonna increase? i.e from Minimum price to Maximum price or % or Mean ?

	a)	What should happen for products which don't have minimum or maximum?

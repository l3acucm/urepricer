Note:

1)	All values present in both markets (UK and US). Just the US market has 1 extra value Club.

2)	“NewOEM” we are considering it as New. Because:
OEM (pronounced as separate letters) is short for original equipment manufacturer, which is a somewhat misleading term used to describe a company that has a special relationship with computer and IT producers. OEMs are typically manufacturers who resell another company's product under their own name and branding.</pre>
